# Computational Geometry Algorithms

This repository implements some of the useful computational geometry algorithms that I have learned. 
I do not aim for speed nor correctness for degenerate cases in some cases. But I try when I can.
Furthermore, I will probably only use rational types (MPFQ) for this repository.
